Just teaching myself PyTorch so I built these image classifiers. Here's the link to the [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zuraiz/fish-vs-cats-imagenet-subdataset).

I used hard coded paths in my files so be sure to upload the zipfile in the right location if u wanna use the code (or change my code).
